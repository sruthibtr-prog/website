                <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
                <p class="lede">Ali Hamadeh, MBA, MSc, B.Acc.</p>
                <p>
                    Ali Hamadeh is a finance professional and bilingual consultant (English &amp; Arabic) with a strong academic and professional background in accounting, auditing, and financial analysis. He earned both his Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Master of Science in Finance (MSc) from Wayne State University, graduating with Distinction in 2025. Ali also holds a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting and Finance from Wayne State (Class of 2022, Dean’s List).
                </p>
                <p>
                    His experience spans multiple areas of public accounting and finance. Ali interned with PwC in both Audit and Tax, and with Plante Moran in Tax Services. Following his internships, he worked for Cohen &amp; Company as an Auditor for two years, gaining hands-on experience with corporate and financial statement audits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, Ali spent four consecutive tax seasons with H&amp;R Block, preparing returns for individuals, small businesses, and sole proprietorships — helping clients navigate the complexities of the U.S. tax system with accuracy and care.
